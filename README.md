# chrome-cli

Open Google Chrome from the command line.

**Note:** Only macOS is supported right now.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g chrome-cli
```

## Usage

The `chrome` command launches and passes its arguments directly to Google Chrome.

```sh
# Open a new window
chrome

# Open a new "incognito" window
chrome --incognito

# Open a local file
chrome file.html

# Open a URL, incognito
chrome https://google.com --incognito
```

By default, this assumes that Chrome is `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`.

To point elsewhere, set the `CHROME` environment variable to the path of your Chrome installation's app bundle. For example, if you use Chrome Canary, you can add the following to your `.bashrc`:

```sh
export CHROME='/Applications/Google Chrome Canary.app'
```
